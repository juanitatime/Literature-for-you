                answered. <em>"I
                    asked
                    the
                    question
                    for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any
                    question--simple
                    <del>peculiarity</del><ins> curiosity.</ins> I have a theory that it is always the women who propose
                    to us, and not we who propose to
                    the
                    women. Except, of course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not modern."</em>

                appearance
                created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
                dirty
                weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and
                <strong>Elizabeth</strong> was
                convinced
                that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
                brother’s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and
                kindness.<strong> Mr.
                    Darcy</strong>
                said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
                brilliancy
                which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far
                alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.

                    see,
                    <strong>Mr.
                        Holmes,</strong>"</em>
                said he, <em>"my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a
                    mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature
                    rather
                    than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and
                    free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is
                    swift
                    in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not
                    have
                    given her the name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had not I
                    thought
                    her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
                    anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."</em>

            <H3>4<sup>th</sup> Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde<sub> by Robert Louis Stevenson</sub></H3>

                <span>T</span> he letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed <strong>“Edward Hyde”</strong>:
                and it
                signified, briefly
                enough,
                that the writer’s benefactor, Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand
                generosities,
                need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure
                dependence.
                The lawyer liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for;
                and
                he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.
